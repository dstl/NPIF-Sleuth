# NPIF-Sleuth

Version 3.2
This folder contains a set of python code to test and explore NPIF (STANAG 7023 files)

This code is intended to help a Subject Matter Expert assess the content of an NPIF file.

The full range of potential outputs of NPIF Sleuth are un-validated and this software is 
used at the risk of the user. While efforts have been made to ensure the code is as 
correct as possible, it cannot be guaranteed that all output will be 100% correct or that 
it will work on every potential input file.

The tool is not sufficient to certify a file as being compliant with the standard, and all
outputs should be carefully reviewed by someone familiar with the NPIF standard.

Please note the Licence conditions (see LICENSE.txt)

## NPIF Splitter

This is a support application to split a STANAG 7023 file into parts (one file per table).
This is probably not of general interest, but may be useful for debugging or generating
test cases.
